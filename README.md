# BRKOPS-2357 Demo Code

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Cisco Live session BRKOPS-2357. This repository contains demonstration code that was used during the session to illustrate a modern approach to network infrastructure management. It provides an insight into how various technologies can be leveraged to automate and manage network configurations and infrastructure as code.

### Key Components

- **Service Definition (JSON):** Use of JSON files for defining the services and configurations managed by Terraform.
- **Service-Based Code (Terraform):** Infrastructure as code approach using Terraform to define and manage network infrastructure.
- **Terraform Modules:** Modular Terraform configurations for different network technologies to apply the desired state.
- **YANG Models:** Utilization of YANG models for structured network configuration and validate variables.
- **Python Scripts (Utils):** A set of utility scripts written in Python to facilitate network management tasks.
- **Service API with Flask RESTX:** A RESTful API service developed with Flask RESTX for managing network configurations dynamically.
- **GitLab CI/CD Configuration:** Configuration file for setting up and using a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, including merge request and merge commit automation.
- **pyATS:** Used for testing the desired state of network configurations and periodically verifying the desired state throughout the lifecycle, ensuring consistency and reliability in network operations.

## Disclaimer

This code is provided as a demonstration and is **not intended for production use**. It's designed to give an idea of how certain problems were tackled within the context of the Cisco Live session and might require significant adaptation to be applied in a real-world scenario.

## Getting Started

To explore and experiment with the code provided in this repository, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of the technologies involved, including Terraform, Python, YANG models, and GitLab CI/CD pipelines.

## Usage

Due to the demo nature of this code, it's not ready to use "out of the box" and will likely require customization to fit your specific environment and requirements. Please review each component's documentation and code comments for guidance on how to adapt and use the code snippets and configurations.
